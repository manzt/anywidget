## Integrations

Several platforms have adopted <u>_native_</u> support for **anywidget**. This
means that you can use **anywidgets** in more places than traditional Jupyter
Widgets:

## Widgets Gallery

**anywidget** powers several [open source
projects](https://github.com/manzt/anywidget/network/dependents). To feature
your **anywidget**, please [submit a
PR](https://github.com/manzt/built-with-anywidget/blob/main/assets/manifest.json).
