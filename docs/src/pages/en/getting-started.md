- create widgets **without complicated cookiecutter templates**
- **publish to PyPI** like any other Python package
- prototype **within** `.ipynb` or `.py` files
- run in **Jupyter**, **JupyterLab**, **Google Colab**, **VSCode**, and more
- develop (optionally) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for **instant HMR**

## What is anywidget?

**anywidget** jupyter widgets, made easy

## Installation

```
pip install anywidget
```

## Usage

```python
import anywidget
import traitlets

CSS = """
.counter-btn {
  background-image: linear-gradient(to right, #a1c4fd, #c2e9fb);
  border: 0;
  border-radius: 10px;
  padding: 10px 50px;
}
"""

ESM = """
export function render(view) {
  let counter = Object.assign(document.createElement("button"), {
    className: "counter-btn",
    innerHTML: `count is ${view.model.get("count")}`,
    onclick: () => {
      view.model.set("count", view.model.get("count") + 1);
      view.model.save_changes();
    },
  });
  view.model.on("change:count", () => {
    counter.innerHTML = `count is ${view.model.get("count")}`;
  });
  view.el.appendChild(counter);
}
"""

class CounterWidget(anywidget.AnyWidget):
    _esm = ESM # required, must export `render`
    _css = CSS # optional
    count = traitlets.Int(0).tag(sync=True)

CounterWidget()
```

## Why

**anywidget** simplifies the creation of custom Jupyter widgets â€“ no complicated
build steps or bundling required.

Official
[cookiecutter templates](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/?q=cookiecutter&type=all&language=&sort=)
provide the defacto approach for creating custom Jupyter widgets, but derived
projects are bootstrapped with complicated packaging and distribution scripts
which must be maintained by the widget author. While the cookiecutters initially
ensure compatability with various notebook or notebook-like environments,
substantial developer effort is required to keep the vendored tooling from
breaking over time.

**anywidget** reduces this burden and improves the Jupyter widget developer
experience. It ensures your widget's compatability with the fractured Jupyter
ecosystem rather than requiring each author to solve this same multi-platform
packaging problem. Creating custom widgets with **anywidget** is fun and easy.
You can start prototyping _within_ a notebook and publish on PyPI like any other
Python module. No need to create a new cookiecutter repo, maintain complicated
build scripts, or understand JavaScript dependency/build tooling to get started.

## How

Widgets are defined by combining an
[ECMAScript Module](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) with a Python class which
derives from `anywidget.AnyWidget`. The provided ECMAScript Module _must_
include a named export called `render` to render the corresponding view. You can
add and sync new properties by adding `traitlets` in your derived Python classes
and subscribing and publishing changes via `view.model` in the client `render`
function.

> **Note** Your JS code _must_ be vaid ESM. You can import dependencies from a
> CDN (e.g., `import * as d3 from "https://esm.sh/d3"`) or use a bundler
> targeting ESM.
