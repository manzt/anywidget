## What is anywidget?

**anywidget** is both a [**specification**](/en/afm) and **toolset** for authoring
reusable web-based widgets for interactive computing environments. As a
specification, it defines a standard for widget front-end code. As a toolkit,
it provides tools for authoring widget front-end code according to the
specification, as well as a Python library that simplifies creating and
publishing custom [Jupyter
Widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).


## Highlights

- 🛠️ Create widgets **without complicated cookiecutter templates**
- 📚 **Publish Jupyter Widgets to PyPI** like any other Python package
- 🤖 Prototype **within** `.ipynb` or `.py` files
- 🚀 Run in **Jupyter**, **JupyterLab**, **Google Colab**, **VSCode**, **marimo**, and more
- ⚡ Develop with **instant HMR**, like modern web frameworks


## Example

The easiest way to start developing with **anywidget** is with the Python package.

```
pip install "anywidget[dev]"
```

```python
import anywidget
import traitlets

class CounterWidget(anywidget.AnyWidget):
    _esm = """
    function render({ model, el }) {
      let button = document.createElement("button");
      button.innerHTML = `count is ${model.get("value")}`;
      button.addEventListener("click", () => {
        model.set("value", model.get("value") + 1);
        model.save_changes();
      });
      model.on("change:value", () => {
        button.innerHTML = `count is ${model.get("value")}`;
      });
      el.classList.add("counter-widget");
      el.appendChild(button);
    }
    export default { render };
    """
    _css = """
    .counter-widget button { color: white; font-size: 1.75rem; background-color: #ea580c; padding: 0.5rem 1rem; border: none; border-radius: 0.25rem; }
    .counter-widget button:hover { background-color: #9a3412; }
    """
    value = traitlets.Int(0).tag(sync=True)

CounterWidget(value=42)
```

<CounterButton size={"lg"} initialValue={42} />

What's going on here:

- `value` is a stateful property that both the client JavaScript and Python have access to.
  Shared state is defined via [traitlets](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with the `sync=True`
  keyword argument.

- `_esm` specifies a <u>**required**</u> [Anywidget Front-End Module (AFM)](/en/afm) for the widget.
  It defines and exports `render`, a function for rendering and initializes dynamic updates for the custom widget.

- `_css` specifies an <u>**optional**</u> CSS stylesheet to load for the widget. It can be a full URL or plain text. Styles are loaded
  in the global scope if using this feature, so take care to avoid naming conflicts.

The Anywidget Front-End Module (AFM) is a web-standard [ECMAScript module
(ESM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
that defines a widget's behavior. It can be authored in a single file using URLs
for third-party dependencies:

```javascript
import * as d3 from "https://esm.sh/d3@7";

/** @param {{ model: DOMWidgetModel, el: HTMLElement }} context */
function render({ model, el }) {
	let selection = d3.select(el);
	/* ... */
}
export default { render };
```

Or produced via [a build step](/en/bundling) to include local dependencies or
use popular JS frameworks (e.g., React, Svelte, Vue). For details on lifecycle
methods and authoring AFM, see the [AFM documentation](/en/afm).

## Progressive Development

As your widgets grow in complexity, it is recommended to separate your
front-end code from your Python code. Just move the `_esm` and `_css`
(from above) to separate files and reference them via path.

```python
import anywidget
import traitlets

class CounterWidget(anywidget.AnyWidget):
    _esm = "index.js"
    _css = "index.css"
    value = traitlets.Int(0).tag(sync=True)
```

This is both easier to read and allows you to use your favorite editor/IDE for your front-end code.
Using file paths also enables **anywidget**'s [built-in HMR](/blog/anywidget-02/#native-hot-module-replacement-hmr),
allowing real-time updates to your widget during development (below).

> **Note**: Since v0.9, **anywidget** requires developers to opt-in to HMR
> using an environment variable:
>
> ```py
> %env ANYWIDGET_HMR=1
> ```
> or when launching a Jupyter session:
>
> ```sh
> ANYWIDGET_HMR=1 jupyter lab
> ```

> **Note**: Prefer `pathlib.Path` for file paths in production and outside
> notebooks to ensure OS compatibility and correct relative path resolution.
>
> ```py
> import pathlib
> import anywidget
> import traitlets
>
> class CounterWidget(anywidget.AnyWidget):
>     _esm = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent / "index.js"
>     _css = pathlib.Path(__file__).parent / "index.css"
>     value = traitlets.Int(0).tag(sync=True)
> ```

## Watch & Learn

This video provides a detailed exploration of **anywidget** fundementals,
including synchronizing Python and JavaScript state, binary data, animations,
and publishing a package on PyPI.

## Relationship to Jupyter Widgets

**anywidget** began as a modern alternative for authoring custom Jupyter
Widgets and is now the [recommended
method](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/widget-cookiecutter) for creating
them. The project has since grown in scope as [AFM](/en/afm) has been adopted
by platforms beyond Python and Jupyter. While maintaining its primary focus on
Jupyter Widgets, **anywidget** now enables the creation of custom widgets for a
variety of interactive computing environments (including Deno, R, and entirely
in the browser).
