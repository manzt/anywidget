## What is anywidget?

**anywidget** is a Python library that simplifies creating and publishing
custom Jupyter widgets. No messy build configuration or complicated cookiecutter templates.

It is <u>**not**</u> a new interactive widgets framework, but rather
an abstraction for creating custom Jupyter widgets using modern web standards.
**anywidget** solves the multi-platform packaging problem for the fragmented Jupyter
ecosystem, allowing your widget to run automatically in **Jupyter Notebooks**,
**Jupyter Lab**, **Google Colab**, **VSCode**, and more.

## Key features

- 🛠️ Create widgets **without complicated cookiecutter templates**
- 📚 **Publish to PyPI** like any other Python package
- 🤖 Prototype **within** `.ipynb` or `.py` files
- 🚀 Run in **Jupyter**, **JupyterLab**, **Google Colab**, **VSCode**, and more
- ⚡ Develop with **instant HMR**, like modern web frameworks

## Example

```
pip install "anywidget[dev]"
```

```python
import anywidget
import traitlets

class CounterWidget(anywidget.AnyWidget):
    _esm = """
    export function render({ model, el }) {
      let getCount = () => model.get("count");
      let button = document.createElement("button");
      button.classList.add("counter-button");
      button.innerHTML = `count is ${getCount()}`;
      button.addEventListener("click", () => {
        model.set("count", getCount() + 1);
        model.save_changes();
      });
      model.on("change:count", () => {
        button.innerHTML = `count is ${getCount()}`;
      });
      el.appendChild(button);
    }
    """
    _css="""
    .counter-button { background-color: #ea580c; }
    .counter-button:hover { background-color: #9a3412; }
    """
    count = traitlets.Int(0).tag(sync=True)

counter = CounterWidget()
counter.count = 42
counter
```

<CounterButton size={"lg"} initialValue={42} />

What's going on here:

- `count` is a stateful property for that both the client JavaScript and Python have access to.
  Shared state is defined via [traitlets](https://traitlets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) with the `sync=True`
  keyword argument.

- `_css` specifies an <u>**optional**</u> CSS stylesheet to load for the widget. It can be a full URL or plain text. Styles are loaded
  in the global scope if using this feature, so take care in avoid global overrides.

- `_esm` specifies a <u>**required**</u> [ECMAScript module](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) for the widget.
  It must _must_ export a `render` custom rendering logic and initializes dynamic updates for the custom widget.

```javascript
/** @param {{ model: DOMWidgetModel, el: HTMLElement }} context */
export function render({ model, el }) {
	// Render model contents and setup dynamic updates
	// See Jupyter widgets docs for more information: https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/8.0.2/examples/Widget%20Custom.html#Rendering-model-contents
}
```

ECMAScript modules are the offical standard format to package JavaScript code for reuse and are supported
natively across [all major browsers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#javascript.statements.export).
Therefore, dependencies can be imported directly via a fully qualified URL.

```javascript
import * as d3 from "https://esm.sh/d3@7";

/** @param {{ model: DOMWidgetModel, el: HTMLElement }} context */
export function render({ model, el }) {
	let selection = d3.select(el);
	/* ... */
}
```

The `render` function can also (optionally) return a callback that is executed any time the view is
removed from the DOM. This feature is useful when dealing with complex event listeners, subscriptions,
or third-party libraries that require proper teardown.

```javascript
/** @param {{ model: DOMWidgetModel, el: HTMLElement }} context */
export function render({ model, el }) {
	// Create DOM elements and set up subscribers
	return () => {
		// Optionally cleanup
	};
}
```

You may optionally [bundle](/en/bundling) your code to a single ESM target so that your widget works offline.

> Both `_esm` and `_css` can either be a Python string containing actual front-end code
> or alternatively **file paths**. If a file path is provided during development,
> you opt in to [**anywidget**'s native HMR](/blog/anywidget-02/#native-hot-module-replacement-hmr).
> **anywidget** will start listening for modifications to the referenced files and instantly
> apply changes to the front-end.

## Motivation

Official
[cookiecutter templates](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/?q=cookiecutter&type=all&language=&sort=)
provide the defacto approach for creating custom Jupyter widgets, but derived
projects are bootstrapped with complicated packaging and distribution scripts
which must be maintained by the widget author. While the cookiecutters initially
ensure compatability with various notebook or notebook-like environments,
substantial developer effort is required to keep the vendored tooling from
breaking over time.

**anywidget** reduces this burden and improves the Jupyter widget developer
experience. It ensures your widget's compatability with the fractured Jupyter
ecosystem rather than requiring each author to solve this same multi-platform
packaging problem. Creating custom widgets with **anywidget** is fun and easy.
You can start prototyping _within_ a notebook and publish on PyPI like any other
Python module. No need to create a new cookiecutter repo, maintain complicated
build scripts, or understand JavaScript dependency/build tooling to get started.
