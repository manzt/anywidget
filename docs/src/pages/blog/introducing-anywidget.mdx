_TL;DR: [**anywidget**](https://github.com/manzt/anywidget) is a new Python library that <u>greatly</u>
simplifies creating and publishing custom Jupyter Widgets. Unlike the traditional
(cookiecutter) approach, with **anywidget** you 1) avoid fiddling with build steps
and bundlers, 2) can <u>prototype widgets from within a notebook</u>, and 3)
get a modern front-end developer experience. **anywidget** allows you to write code like this:_

```python
import anywidget
import traitlets


class CounterWidget(anywidget.AnyWidget):
    # Widget front-end JavaScript code
    _esm = """
    export function render({ model, el }) {
      let getCount = () => model.get("count");
      let button = document.createElement("button");
      button.innerHTML = `count is ${getCount()}`;
      button.addEventListener("click", () => {
        model.set("count", getCount() + 1);
        model.save_changes();
      });
      model.on("change:count", () => {
        button.innerHTML = `count is ${getCount()}`;
      });
      el.appendChild(button);
    }
    """
    # Stateful property that can be accessed by JavaScript & Python
    count = traitlets.Int(0).tag(sync=True)
```

_... to create custom widgets that work in Jupyter notebooks, JupyterLab, Google
Colab, VS&nbsp;Code, and more. No messy build configuration or bundlers. It Just Works<sup>TM</sup>!_ <a href="#hello-anywidget">Skip ahead.</a>

## Background

### Jupyter Ascending

Computational notebooks are ubiquitous in data analysis and programming
education. [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is the _de facto_ standard in the
Python world, providing a web-based interface to execute code and embed
computational outputs with prose or multimedia in a single document. Its modular
design enables users to modify behavior and extend functionality to fit custom
workflows.

[Jupyter Widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is the official
framework to extend notebook output cells in the browser with interactive
views or controls for Python objects in the Jupyter kernel. Custom widgets enable interactive data
exploration and visualization **during analysis**. Widgets connect Python code
to responsive and sophisticated user interfaces built with modern web
technologies, bridging the gap between the web platform and Python ecosystem.

A custom widget is composed of two separate programs:

1. Python code that runs in the notebook kernel
2. JavaScript code that renders the widget in the browser and communicates with
   Python

![two components of a Jupyter widget, the JS front end and Python backend](/widget-overview.png)

### The Multi-Platform Problem

With the rise in popularity of Jupyter notebooks, there are a growing number of ways
to view and execute `.ipynb`, including JupyterLab, Google Colab, and VS Code.
However, these notebook environments vary with regard to support for extensions,
specifically Jupyter Widgets.

In order to support Jupyter Widgets, each application
implements its own mechanism to **discover** widget front-end code, then **load** and **execute** the
JavaScript. This process is not standardized, in contrast to loading the associated Python program
in the application kernel, and widget authors are thus tasked with packaging their JavaScript
code for multiple notebook environments, each with its own requirements and quirks.

![Widget front-end source code (JavaScript) requires is transformed and packaged into separate files for JupyterLab, Jupyter notebooks, Google Colab, VS Code](/client-js-diagram.png)

To a seasoned front-end engineer, this problem likely appears well suited for a
JavaScript
[_bundler_](https://dev.to/underscorecode/javascript-bundlers-an-in-depth-comparative-is-webpack-still-the-best-bundler-in-2021-59jk),
and it is. The issue is that **every widget author currently solves the <u>same</u> multi-platform problem**
with bundling, and the solution requires long-term maintenance. Not only must the JavaScript tooling stay up to date with the fast-moving
front-end ecosystem, but bundler configurations must be adapted to the latest – and
mostly undocumented – requirements imposed by each notebook environment.

### A Solution with Crumbs

To address this issue, the Jupyter team recommends an approach using
[cookiecutters](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/?q=cookiecutter&type=all&language=&sort=),
or recipes for creating new custom Jupyter Widgets. While the cookiecutters
initially ensure compatibility with Jupyter and multiple notebook environments, there
can be a steep learning curve for developers unfamiliar with the prescribed
front-end tooling (i.e., `yarn`, Webpack, Babel, ESLint, and Jest) and substantial
effort is **still required to keep the inherited build system up to
date with the latest platform requirements**.

Additionally, the recommended Python build systems
differ significantly between the official templates and are bootstrapped with
features which may or may not be required for a given project. For example, the
JavaScript-based cookiecutter uses (deprecated)
[`jupyter-packaging`](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter-packaging)
(configured with `setup.py` + `setup.cfg` + `pyproject.toml`), whereas the TypeScript-based
cookiecutter uses the more modern [`hatch-jupyter-builder`](https://github.com/jupyterlab/hatch-jupyter-builder)
plugin for [Hatch](https://github.com/pypa/hatch) (configured with `pyproject.toml`). Understanding
the differences requires knowledge of both modern JavaScript and Python packaging, and
rolling a solution from scratch is [_very_ challenging to do correctly](https://twitter.com/trevmanz/status/1491815033734668288).
In the end, the easiest path forward is to just pick a template and treat it like a blackbox ... until something breaks.

<blockquote>

For the curious reader, I created two separate projects for a `mywidget` package using the
official cookiecutters and included the generated directories below.

<br />

This section is not intended to critique the design choices by the Jupyter team and community members – **these recipes
are used widely** - but to illustrate the large surface area a widget author is responsible for both understanding and maintaining after project initialization.
For anyone who has used `create-react-app`, it is reminiscent of running `react-script eject` and
vendoring all the build scripts.

It is worth noting that this maintenance surface area is incurred for

<u>every</u> new project derived from one of the cookiecutters.

</blockquote>

Besides the front-end packaging problem, a key limitation in the current
state of Jupyter Widgets is that **prototyping requires the creation and installation of a
new Python package** due to the mechanism by which Jupyter **discovers** widget front-end
code. Prototyping _must_ be done in either a classic Jupyter notebook
or JupyterLab\* where the custom widget extensions have been registered manually
to each of these environments.

```bash
# mywidget/

# install the Python package
pip install -e .

# add extension to classic Jupyter notebook
jupyter nbextension install --py --symlink --overwrite --sys-prefix mywidget
jupyter nbextension enable --py --sys-prefix mywidget

# add extension to JupyterLab
jupyter labextension develop --overwrite mywidget

# rebuild the JavaScript when you make changes ...
yarn run build
```

This requirement creates a barrier to entry for many new Python
and JavaScript programmers. Whereas regular Python modules can be prototyped
in standalone `.py` files or even notebook cells and gradually transitioned to
pip-installable packages, widgets need to be `pip` installed from the beginning.

Finally, the front-end development ecosystem has matured rapidly over the last decade
to enable instant, precise updates to client code without reloading the page or
blowing away application state. Unfortunately, widget authors do not currently
benefit from these advancements due to the legacy mechanism used by Jupyter front ends
to **load** widget JavaScript. Instead, **full page reloads are necessary to view
changes applied to the front-end widget code** and development feels sluggish compared
to modern front-end applications.

In summary, Jupyter notebooks are ubiquitous and Jupyter Widgets is the standard framework
to extend notebook output cells in the browser with rich, interactive views or controls
for Python objects in the Jupyter kernel. However, the growing number of notebook environments
has resulted in a fragmented ecosystem that assumes reusable widgets are only possible
if widget authors:

1. Learn and understand front-end build tooling
2. Solve the same multi-packaging problem
3. Create a new Python package before prototyping
4. Use outdated web technologies for live development

> \*To my knowledge, it is not possible to develop custom widgets in
> Google Colab or VS Code since the JavaScript code must be published to
> `npm` (and available via a CDN like https://unpkg.com).

### ECMAScript Modules to the Rescue

The complexity involved with packaging custom Jupyter Widgets primarily arises
from the need to transform a custom widget's JavaScript to target the various module systems
employed by different notebook environments. But what if this step could
be abstracted away?

First introduced in 2015, [ECMAScript modules (ESM)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules)
are now the official standard format to package JavaScript code for reuse. All major browsers [support ESM natively](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules#javascript.statements.import),
exposing a **common mechanism to load and execute JavaScript**. ESM wasn't
around when Jupyter and its derivatives were first created, but support
now exists in _all_ of these tools because they run in web browsers!

With ESM, the following code runs in all major browsers without modifications:

```javascript
import * as d3 from "https://esm.sh/d3@7";

export function currentDate() {
	let formatTime = d3.timeFormat("%B %d, %Y");
	console.log(`Today is ${formatTime(new Date())}`);
}

currentDate(); // Today is January 18, 2023
```

## Hello, anywidget

**anywidget** is a Python library that makes custom Jupyter Widgets easy. It is <u>**not**</u>
a new widgets framework, but rather an abstraction around Jupyter Widgets that leverages ESM. **anywidget**
is a traditional custom widget whose sole purpose is to both:

- solve the multi-platform problem
- load and execute ESM sent from the Python kernel

![overview of anywidget implementation. anywidget loads and executes widget JavaScript code sent from the Python kernel](/anywidget-overview.png)

In this sense, **anywidget** is really a "meta" framework for creating new widgets. You – the widget developer –
define ESM and an associated Python class (i.e., a Jupyter Widget), and **anywidget** takes care of the rest.

A consequence of this design is that it drastically lowers the barrier to entry for many potential
widget developers. The data scientist with minimal JavaScript experience can begin prototyping her idea
for a domain-specific Jupyter integration directly within a notebook (and also learn front-end). No need to first
install Node.js and understand JavaScript tooling. Conversely, a front-end engineer can learn Python
by turning one of their JavaScript libraries into a widget within Google Colab. No need to deal with
virtual environments or learn how Python modules work.

**anywidget** also adapts to a wide spectrum of use cases, enabling prototypes to incrementally
mature into robust Python packages. A student can save and share widgets via notebooks,
while an engineer can package and version the widgets he's created for clients and co-workers.
As an **anywidget** project matures, the JavaScript code can be moved from inline strings to separate files to
[bundled assets](/en/bundling) when the complexity of the application demands it.

Lastly, since **anywidget** bypasses the various platform-specific module systems in favor
of native ESM, users have the option to opt-in to an improved developer experience with
modern front-end development tools. The [Vite plugin](/en/bundling#development)
for **anywidget** extends [Vite's](https://vitejs.dev/) development server with precise
[Hot Module Replacement](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#hot-module-replacement) support for Jupyter Widgets.
Changes made to the JavaScript source during development are **instantly** reflected
in the front end without refreshing or re-executing notebook cells.

### Get Started

```bash
pip install anywidget
```

Using **anywidget** is exactly like creating a custom widget with [`ipywidgets`](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/ipywidgets),
except for where your widget front-end code lives. Custom widgets are defined by subclassing `anywidget.AnyWidget`:

```python
import anywidget
import traitlets

class ExampleWidget(anywidget.AnyWidget):
    # anywidget, required #
    _esm = """
    export function render({ model, el }) {
        el.classList.add("custom-widget");
        function value_changed() {
            el.textContent = model.get("value");
        }
        value_changed();
        model.on("change:value", value_changed);
    }
    """
    # anywidget, optional #
    _css = """
    .custom-widget {
        background-color: lightseagreen;
        padding: 0px 2px;
    }
    """
    # custom state for the widget #
    value = traitlets.Unicode("Hello World").tag(sync=True)

ExampleWidget()
```

<div style="background-color: lightseagreen; padding: 0px 2px;">
	Hello, World
</div>

... and each subclass specifies:

- `_esm` the <u>**required**</u> ECMAScript module for the widget. It must
  export a `render` function to define custom rendering logic and initialize dynamic
  updates for the widget.

```javascript
/** @param {{ model: DOMWidgetModel, el: HTMLElement }} context */
export function render({ model, el }) {
	// Render model contents and setup dynamic updates
}
```

- `_css` an <u>**optional**</u> CSS stylesheet to load for the widget.

All custom stateful properties (e.g., `ExampleWidget.value`) are defined via [`traitlets`](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/8.0.2/examples/Widget%20Custom.html#sync=True-traitlets)
with the `sync=True` metadata – just like regular Jupyter Widgets!

> Note: the `ExampleWidget` is a reproduction of the starter
> widget from the Jupyter [cookiecutter](https://github.com/jupyter-widgets/widget-ts-cookiecutter/blob/master/%7B%7Bcookiecutter.github_project_name%7D%7D/src/widget.ts),
> produced in a single file in ~20 lines of code. You can copy any paste
> this snippet into any notebook environment and run (or modify) the widget
> without additional installation or setup.

### Examples

#### Two-Way Data Binding

The `ExampleWidget` demonstrates simple one-way data binding from the Python kernel
to front-end view. This example is slightly more sophisicated and synchronizes the
model state between the widget front end and the Python kernel (i.e., two-way data binding).

The `render` function creates a `button` element and registers an event handler
to increment `count` when the button is clicked. A second event handler
updates the text output any time `count` changes.

By treating the model as the source of truth, regardless of whether `count` is updated on the
Python side or the JavaScript side, the count displayed remains correct. You can learn more
about model view controller (MVC), the IPython widget framework
the front end relies on, in the Jupyter Widgets [documentation](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/8.0.2/examples/Widget%20Custom.html#Models-and-views).

```python
import anywidget
import traitlets


class CounterWidget(anywidget.AnyWidget):
    _esm = """
    export function render({ model, el }) {
      let getCount = () => model.get("count");
      let button = document.createElement("button");
      button.classList.add("counter-button");
      button.innerHTML = `count is ${getCount()}`;
      button.addEventListener("click", () => {
        model.set("count", getCount() + 1);
        model.save_changes();
      });
      model.on("change:count", () => {
        button.innerHTML = `count is ${getCount()}`;
      });
      el.appendChild(button);
    }
    """
    _css="""
    .counter-button { background-color: #ea580c; }
    .counter-button:hover { background-color: #9a3412; }
    """
    count = traitlets.Int(0).tag(sync=True)

counter = CounterWidget()
counter.count = 42
counter
```

<CounterButton size={"lg"} initialValue={42} />

#### Third-party dependencies

Any valid ESM is supported by **anywidget**, so dependencies can be imported
directly from a CDN via URL as long as they are also ESM. Browser
support for modules means these imports are optimized and cached in subsequent
requests.

```python
import anywidget

class ConfettiWidget(anywidget.AnyWidget):
    _esm = """
    import confetti from "https://esm.sh/canvas-confetti@1.6";

    export function render({ model, el }) {
      let btn = document.createElement("button");
      btn.classList.add("confetti-button");
      btn.innerHTML = "click me!";
      btn.addEventListener("click", () => {
        confetti();
      });
      el.appendChild(btn);
    }
    """
    _css="""
    .confetti-button { background-color: #ea580c; }
    .confetti-button:hover { background-color: #9a3412; }
    """

ConfettiWidget()
```

<ConfettiButton size={"lg"} />

### Try It Out!

Today, I released **anywidget** v0.1. You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/manzt/anywidget) and
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/anywidget/). To install, just run:

```bash
pip install anywidget
```

**anywidget** is new and still under active development. **It should _not_
yet be used in production since the API can change and some critical features are missing**.
With that said, it is already [in use](https://github.com/vitessce/vitessce-python) and ready for testing.

I hope using **anywidget** is simple and enjoyable. I have personally found
it valuable in my work as a visualization researcher to quickly iterate on new
ideas to interactively explore biomedical datasets.

If **anywidget** is interesting or exciting to you, please reach out and get involved
on [GitHub](https://github.com/manzt/anywidget)! Happy coding.
