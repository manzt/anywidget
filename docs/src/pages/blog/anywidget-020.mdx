_TL;DR: **anywidget** v0.2 brings modern web development to Jupyter. You can now provide a **file path**
for either `_esm` or `_css` attributes to enable **anywidget**'s integrated Hot Module Replacement (HMR)._

```python
import pathlib
import anywidget
import traitlets

class Counter(anywidget.AnyWidget):
    _esm = pathlib.Path("index.js")
    value = traitlets.Int(0).tag(sync=True)
```

_File contents are read automatically from disk, and any changes made to the JavaScript or CSS source
during development are instantly reflected in the front end without refreshing or re-executing notebook
cells. The release also includes various bug fixes and improved support for rendering widgets in Google Colab.

## Bringing Modern Web Development to Jupyter

I'm very excited to announce **anywidget** v0.2, a significant update that bring new
features to dramatically improve the widget development experience. Some of these features
have been on my wishlist for Jupyter Widget for a while, and I am thrilled to share them in this release!

### Native Hot Module Replacement (HMR):

Hot Module Replacement (HMR) is a powerful feature implemented in modern frameworks
like [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) that enables developers to see changes in their
application's user interface without requiring full page load or clearing application
state. This is achieved by updating only the specific modules in the application
that have been modified, rather than refreshing the entire application. After experiencing
web development with HMR, it becomes increasingly frustrating to use frameworks that lack this
feature.

Although the initial release of **anywidget** incorporated a custom plugin to facilitate HMR
development with Vite, it still posed a barrier for Python developers seeking an exceptional
user experience. While Vite offers a best-in-class developer experience, its full feature set may
not be crucial for numerous **anywidget** projects. Furthermore, enabling live-reloading with Vite
required additional setup and configuration with frontend tooling, which could be cumbersome
for developers.

We released an implementation of HMR on top of of the Jupyter Widgets framework directly
within **anywidget** in a prior release, but in v0.2 it is fully integrated in the top-level API.
This feature provides a seamless (opt-in) front-end development experience on par with modern
front-end frameworks.

### Automatic detection and loading of front-end code

**anywidget** previously required `_esm` and `_css` file contents to be read manually 
from disk as Python strings:

```python
class Counter(anywidget.AnyWidget):
    _esm = pathlib.Path("index.js").read_text()

```

in v0.2, you can now drop the `read_text()` and pass a string for a file path or a
`pathlib.Path` object directly.

```python
class Counter(anywidget.AnyWidget):
    _esm = pathlib.Path("index.js")
```

During development, **anywidget** will start listening for changes
to the source files and apply HMR any time the file contents change. This
feature enables **modern web-development entirely from within Jupyter Lab**. 
You can check out an example of this feature in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=600PU6E4Srw).


### Front-end types and strictness


This next release includes a `anywidget/types` submodule for  

to the npm package to allow opt-in strictness: With the
  inclusion of TypeScript types, anywidget now offers improved type checking and
  code quality by ensuring that the correct data types are used in your
  JavaScript code.

## Bug Fixes and Improved Google Colab Support:

In addition to the new features, we have addressed various bugs to enhance the
overall stability and performance of anywidget. Furthermore, we have worked on
improving and providing more consistent support for rendering widgets in Google
Colab, making it easier to create and share custom Jupyter widgets across
different platforms.


## Get Started with anywidget v0.2:

To start using **anywidget** v0.2, upgrade your package using pip:

```python
pip install --upgrade anywidget
```
