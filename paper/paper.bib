               user-centric support in the lifecycle of research activities,
               for example, discovering and accessing research assets or
               composing and executing application workflows. A typical VRE is
               often implemented as an integrated environment, including a
               catalog of research assets, a workflow management system, a data
               management framework, and tools for enabling user collaboration.
               In contrast, notebook environments like Jupyter allow
               researchers to rapidly prototype scientific code and share their
               experiments as online accessible notebooks. Jupyter can support
               several popular languages used by data scientists, such as
               Python, R, and Julia. However, such notebook environments do not
               have seamless support for running heavy computations on remote
               infrastructure or finding and accessing collaborative software
               code inside notebooks. This article investigates the gap between
               a notebook environment and a VRE and proposes an embedded VRE
               solution for the Jupyter environment called Notebook-as-a-VRE
               (NaaVRE). The NaaVRE solution provides functional components via
               a component marketplace and allows users to create a customized
               VRE on top of the Jupyter environment. From the VRE, a user can
               search research assets (data, software, and algorithms), compose
               workflows, manage the lifecycle of an experiment, and share the
               results among users in the community. We demonstrate how such a
               solution can enhance a legacy workflow that uses Light Detection
               and Ranging (LiDAR) data from country-wide airborne laser
               scanning surveys for deriving geospatial data products of
               ecosystem structure at high resolution over broad spatial
               extents. This enables users to scale out the processing of
               multi-terabyte LiDAR point clouds for ecological applications to
               more data sources in a distributed cloud environment. Similar
               applications could be developed for workflows producing other

               scientific computing. We argue that even though Jupyter helps
               users perform complex, technical work, Jupyter itself solves
               problems that are fundamentally human in nature. Namely, Jupyter
               helps humans to think and tell stories with code and data. We
               illustrate this by describing three dimensions of Jupyter: 1)
               interactive computing; 2) computational narratives; and 3) the
               idea that Jupyter is more than software. We illustrate the
               impact of these dimensions on a community of practice in earth
               and climate science.",

  abstract = "Mosaic is an architecture for greater scalability, extensibility,
              and interoperability of interactive data views. Mosaic decouples
              data processing from specification logic: clients publish their
              data needs as declarative queries that are then managed and
              automatically optimized by a coordinator that proxies access to a
              scalable data store. Mosaic generalizes Vegalite's selection
              abstraction to enable rich integration and linking across
              visualizations and components such as menus, text search, and
              tables. We demonstrate Mosaic's expressiveness, extensibility,
              and interoperability through examples that compose diverse
              visualization, interaction, and optimization techniques-many
              constructed using vgplot, a grammar of interactive graphics in
              which graphical marks act as Mosaic clients. To evaluate
              scalability, we present benchmark studies with order-of-magnitude
              performance improvements over existing web-based visualization
              systems-enabling flexible, real-time visual exploration of
              billion+ record datasets. We conclude by discussing Mosaic's
              potential as an open platform that bridges visualization
              languages, scalable visualization, and interactive data systems
              more broadly.",

              and integrates seamlessly within computational notebooks
              environments to enable new interactive analysis workflows.
              AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION: Gos is released under the MIT
              License and available on the Python Package Index (PyPI). The
              source code is publicly available on GitHub
